# A simple XML feed aggregator made for [10k Apart Challenge](https://a-k-apart.com)

As part of the [10k Apart Challenge](https://a-k-apart.com) I built this simple XML feed aggrigator where the initial payload is less than 10kb. The aggregator works even without JavaScript by rendering 10 feed items on server side. For more rules, please refer: https://a-k-apart.com/faq.

### Demo: http://lab.abhinayrathore.com/feed-aggregator/

## Features:
* Under 10kb of initial payload
* Follows web accessibility guidelines
* Mobile first responsive design

## Under 10kb limit

According to [challenge rules](https://a-k-apart.com/faq#size), the initial payload size including HTML document, stylesheets and scripts should be less than 10kb in size (gzipped).
